One can only reveal the message, if he/she owns the key to unlock. My project, color encryption, inherit form this idea. However, instead of using numbers and algorithms to encrypt a message, different color is being used.  Someone can unlock the message if and only if they know the length and the pattern of the color blocks (note: color block is a block of color that represents a word, each word separate by space. Examples are shown below). For this encryption program, punctuations and Arabic numerals will not be converted. As result, if a person does not know the key, all he can see is just colors, punctuations and numbers.
